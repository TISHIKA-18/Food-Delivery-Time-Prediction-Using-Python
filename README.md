# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Python

## Project Overview
This project predicts the delivery time for food orders using machine learning techniques. The model considers various factors like delivery person's age, ratings, and distance between the restaurant and delivery location to predict the delivery time. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of predictions and optimize the delivery process.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-time-prediction.git

### Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in the data/ directory. It contains information on delivery times, delivery person details, and geographical data.

### Model Description
The model implemented is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is suitable for time-series prediction. Additional models, including Random Forests, were used for feature importance analysis.

### Performance Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)

### Results
Key insights from the project:
- Distance is the most influential feature affecting delivery time.
- Model Accuracy: The LSTM model achieves an RMSE of [insert value] minutes.
- Visualizations: Distribution of delivery times, feature importance, and anomaly detection are explored in depth.

### Future Work
Future improvements include:
- Enhancing model accuracy using ensemble methods.
- Integrating real-time data for dynamic predictions.
- Implementing reinforcement learning for optimizing resource allocation.
