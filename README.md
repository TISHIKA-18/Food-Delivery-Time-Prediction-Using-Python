# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Python

## Project Overview
This project predicts the delivery time for food orders using machine learning techniques. The model considers various factors like delivery person's age, ratings, and distance between the restaurant and delivery location to predict the delivery time. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of predictions and optimize the delivery process.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-time-prediction.git

### Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in the data/ directory. It contains information on delivery times, delivery person details, and geographical data.

### Model Description
The model implemented is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is suitable for time-series prediction. Additional models, including Random Forests, were used for feature importance analysis.

### Performance Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)

### Project Insights and Outcomes
Predicting Delivery Time
The LSTM model predicts delivery time based on age, ratings, and distance. This prediction helps businesses estimate delivery times for incoming orders.

Feature Importance
By using SHAP values with a Random Forest model, we provide an interpretable model output showing which features are most influential in determining delivery time.

Identifying Patterns/Anomalies
Clustering analysis with KMeans and PCA helps identify patterns or anomalies in delivery data that could indicate inefficiencies or areas for improvement.

Optimizing Resource Allocation
While direct resource optimization isn't explicitly coded, the model’s predictive capabilities and feature importance insights provide the basis for optimizing delivery personnel and vehicle allocation in real-time systems.

Model Robustness and Scalability
Techniques like early stopping, dropout layers, and learning rate reduction ensure the model is robust and can generalize well to new data, crucial for real-world applications.

Interpreting Influences
SHAP analysis helps in interpreting the influence of individual features, making the model's decision-making process transparent and actionable.

Scalability and Real-Time Integration
The final part of the code demonstrates how to predict delivery times in real-time, laying the groundwork for integrating this model into a live system.

Key insights from the project:
- Distance is the most influential feature affecting delivery time.
- Model Accuracy: The LSTM model achieves an RMSE of [insert value] minutes.
- Visualizations: Distribution of delivery times, feature importance, and anomaly detection are explored in depth.

### Future Work
Future improvements include:
- Enhancing model accuracy using ensemble methods.
- Integrating real-time data for dynamic predictions.
- Implementing reinforcement learning for optimizing resource allocation.
